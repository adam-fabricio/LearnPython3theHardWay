Study Drill.
1 - Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
2 - Read each one backward or out loud to find your error.
3 - From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what
    kind of mistake you made.
4 - When you go to the next exercice, look at the mistake you have made and try
    not to make then in this new one.
5 - Remember that everyone make mistakes. Programmer are like magicians who
    fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong. but it's all
    an act. they make mistakes all the time.
